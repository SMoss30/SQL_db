# SQL_db
Fictional swim school db created in SQL. 

You will find a database for a fictional swims school. It compromises of 3 tables, named children ( containing personal information such as DOB, name etc), swim_stages (detailing each swim level and the requirements to move to the next level) and progress (noting what level each child is at and what the next step is).

I have utilised various data types, constraints, and aggregate functions and have also produced a number of queries to retrieve data. A procedure has been created to delete a student when they reach a certain level and when used in conjunction with the SELECT query, above it, it will successfully prompt you if attempting to delete a student which doesn't meet the requirements. Please note that some points of the assignment have been incorporated within the procedure, such as the final SELECT statement and the DELETE query. I hope that's okay.
